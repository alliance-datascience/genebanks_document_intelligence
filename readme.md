# Data Extraction and Processing Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook aimed at automating data extraction and processing tasks. The primary focus is on extracting meaningful information from images and managing this data for further use. The notebook integrates multiple libraries and implements custom logic to ensure flexibility and scalability.

## Key Features
- **Data Handling**: 
  - Utilizes `pandas` for creating, transforming, and managing tabular data efficiently.
- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Leverages `os` and `yaml` to load environmental variables and configurations dynamically.
- **API Integration**:
  - Implements API requests (e.g., OpenAI API) for tasks like text extraction or processing.
- **Text Parsing**:
  - Employs `re` (regular expressions) to identify and extract specific patterns from text.
- **Image Encoding**:
  - Encodes image data to base64 format for easy transmission via APIs or storage.
- **Custom Functions**:
  - `encode_image`: Converts images into a base64 string.
  - `extract_json_from_string`: Extracts JSON data embedded in text, ensuring structured data parsing.

## Code Workflow
1. **Import Libraries**: The notebook starts by importing the required Python libraries, ensuring the dependencies are in place.
2. **Configuration Management**: Reads environment variables (e.g., API keys) using `os` and `yaml` for seamless setup.
3. **Data Extraction from Images**:
   - Encodes image data into base64 format to be compatible with API requirements.
   - Sends the encoded data to APIs for analysis or processing.
4. **Text and JSON Parsing**:
   - Extracts embedded JSON from API responses or raw strings using regular expressions and custom functions.
5. **Data Transformation**:
   - Processes extracted data into structured formats like DataFrames for analysis or storage.
6. **Error Handling**:
   - Implements robust mechanisms to manage API errors or invalid responses.

## Libraries Used
The notebook employs the following libraries:
- `base64`: For encoding and decoding data.
- `json`: To handle JSON data structures.
- `os`: To manage file paths and environment variables.
- `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
- `re`: To work with regular expressions.
- `requests`: For making HTTP API calls.
- `yaml`: To read and write YAML configuration files.
